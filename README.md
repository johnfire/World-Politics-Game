test game
this is an experiemnt to learn about python. its going to be some kind of simulation  of world politics, i havent figured out if its a game or a simulater yet.
working on it

the main program is the file gamegui.py - you also need the game_classes1.py file and the fotos in the fotos folder. the files labeled blahblah.data are data files for testing.

right now i am just getting the data entry functions running.

at some point ill  expand the world object to include the functions of the game engine, not sure yet how thats going to work.
basically the user will run thru a bunch of conflict areas and chose what the players in that area are going to do, then the program will produce an output.
